## Why This Project

> "Why not?" - Pramoda S R, Oct 2025 (He was not sane)

The _real_ reason is I want to learn zustand, work with or around re-rendering and potentially open source the UI later.

## How This Project

Base Form components similar to shadcn components that I can use in other projects later on down the line with a simple npx command (component registry comming soon)
